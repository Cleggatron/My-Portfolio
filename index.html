        <p>About me: My name is David Clegg and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I come from a background in resource management for a contact centre. This has given me the skills to work in a pressured environment to hit multiple KPI's in the most efficient manner available. It also entailed the co-ordination with the various operational managers about the deployment of their resource effectively, and providing meaningful insight into why targets were, or were not, achieved. This meant the creation of ad-hoc reporting and analysis, as well as long term reports for ongoing use. My passion for problem solving and building useful projects is what has brought me into the world of coding and the pursuit of a career in this field. Outside of work my primary interests are historical swordfighting, reading, and board games.</p>
